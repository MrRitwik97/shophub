## 🔧 **Fix 1: Sign Up Button Issue - RESOLVED**

### **Problem:**
Both "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons were opening the login modal instead of the respective forms.

### **Solution:**
Fixed the `AuthModal` component to properly respond to the `initialMode` prop changes.

**File Updated:** `src/components/auth/AuthModal.tsx`
```typescript
// Added useEffect to update modal mode when prop changes
useEffect(() => {
  setMode(initialMode);
}, [initialMode]);
```

### **How to Test:**
1. ✅ Click "Sign In" → Should open login form
2. ✅ Click "Sign Up" → Should open registration form
3. ✅ Switch between forms using the links at the bottom

## 🔧 **Fix 2: Image Upload System - COMPLETED**

### **Problem:**
Product creation only accepted image URLs, but you wanted actual file upload functionality for local storage.

### **Solution:**
Created a comprehensive image upload system with drag-and-drop, preview, and local storage.

**New Files Created:**
- `src/components/ImageUpload.tsx` - Complete image upload component

**Files Updated:**
- `src/components/AdminPanel.tsx` - Integrated new image upload

### **Features Added:**

#### 🖼️ **Complete Image Upload System:**
- **File Upload**: Click or drag-and-drop to upload images
- **Multiple Images**: Support for up to 5 images per product
- **Image Preview**: Real-time preview of uploaded images
- **File Validation**: 
  - Only image files (PNG, JPG, GIF)
  - Maximum 5MB per image
  - Maximum 5 images total
- **Base64 Storage**: Images converted to base64 for local storage
- **Primary Image**: First image marked as primary
- **Remove Images**: Easy removal with X button on hover
- **Responsive Grid**: Looks great on desktop and mobile

#### 📱 **UI/UX Improvements:**
- **Upload Area**: Large, intuitive upload zone when no images
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows "Uploading..." during file processing
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid files
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive feedback on image removal
- **Help Text**: Clear instructions and limitations

### **How to Test Image Upload:**

#### **Admin Login & Product Creation:**
1. **Login as Admin:**
   - Email: `admin@shophub.com`
   - Password: `AdminPassword123!`

2. **Access Admin Panel:**
   - Click user menu → "Admin Panel"
   - Go to "Products" tab
   - Click "Add Product"

3. **Test Image Upload:**

   - **Click Upload**: Browse and select image files (PNG, JPG, GIF)
   - **Multiple Images**: Select multiple files at once
   - **Preview**: See immediate previews in grid layout
   - **Remove Images**: Hover over images and click X button
   - **Primary Image**: First image shows "Primary" badge
   - **Validation**: Try uploading non-image files (should show error)
   - **Size Limit**: Try uploading files > 5MB (should show error)

4. **Complete Product Creation:**
   - Fill in all other product details
   - Submit form
   - Images will be stored as base64 in localStorage
   - View product in the store to see uploaded images

### **Technical Implementation:**

#### **Image Processing:**
```typescript
// Converts uploaded files to base64 for storage
const convertToBase64 = (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
    reader.onload = () => resolve(reader.result as string);
    reader.onerror = error => reject(error);
  });
};
```

#### **Storage:**
- Images stored as base64 strings in localStorage
- Automatically persists with product data
- No external dependencies required
- Works completely offline

#### **Validation:**
- File type checking (`file.type.startsWith('image/')`)
- File size validation (max 5MB)
- Maximum image count (5 images)
- Required validation (at least 1 image)

## 🧪 **Complete Test Workflow:**

### **1. Authentication Test:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173
# Test both Sign In and Sign Up buttons
```

### **2. Image Upload Test:**
```bash
# Login as admin
# Go to Admin Panel → Products → Add Product
# Test image upload with various file types and sizes
# Create a complete product with uploaded images
# View the product in the store
```

### **3. End-to-End Test:**
```bash
# 1. Register new customer account
# 2. Browse products (some should have uploaded images)
# 3. Add products to cart
# 4. Login as admin
# 5. Create new product with image uploads
# 6. View new product in store
```
